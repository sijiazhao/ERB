# ERB
Compute ERB power from sound files in MATLAB

This script uses ERB package from Alain de Cheveign√© (http://audition.ens.fr/adc/).

## How to use?
Download this whole package. Put your sound files (in .wav format) in the folder 'Sounds'.
Then run 'computeERB.m'. You will get a figure saved as 'fig01_ERB.png' and the variable 'ERB' lists all sound files' ERB values.
